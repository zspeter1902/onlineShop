          the products, even if <span>MyName</span> has been advised of the
          possibility of such damages. Applicable law may not allow the
          limitation of exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential

          visitors, <span>MyName</span> may link to sites operated by third
          parties. However, even if the third party is affiliated with
          <span>MyName</span>, <span>MyName</span> has no control over these
          linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection
          practices, independent of <span>MyName</span>. These linked sites
          are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your
          own risk. Nonetheless,<span>MyName</span> seeks to protect the
          integrity of its web site and the links placed upon it and therefore
          requests any feedback on not only its own site, but for sites it
          links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).<br><br><strong>Different pricing currencies</strong><br><br>Pricing of products sold by <span>MyName</span> is
          labelled by U.S. Dollars (US$). Prices displayed in other currencies
          are converted from U.S. Dollars according to the most up to date
          conversion rates.<br><br>Due to fluctuating currency values,
          prices displayed in non-U.S. denominations of currency on the Site,
          other than on the individual product page, may not be the most
          current. Areas of the Site where non-U.S. denominations of currency
          might be inaccurate include, but are not limited to, promotional
          banners, promotional pages, and information on product category
          pages. The price displayed on an individual product page, regardless
          of currency denomination, is the current price you are liable to pay
          to <span>MyName</span>, excluding shipping.<br><br>All rights
